# Assumptions

## Persistence

If this was a real world application, I'd assume there would be a more realistic solution for persistence (e.g. a database.)

Cookies are used in this prototype, however, they have some drawbacks which would render them impractical in the real world. Mainly the size limit.

## JS Required

This app assumed that the user is using a JS-enabled browser. While SSR allows us to build apps that don't require client-side JS, it is deemed outside the scope of this test.

## Browser compatibility

The app has been created for the latest 2 versions of browsers. Tested on Chrome, Safari (iOS), Chrome (Android) and IE11.
